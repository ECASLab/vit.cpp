# vit.cpp
The objective of the project is to :

* Create a simple C/C++ inference engine for Vision Transformer models with no dependencies

The implementation is destined to be lightweigt and self-contained to be able to run it on different platforms.
This is a work in progress.

This is inspired by the following projects:
* [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp)
* [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)
